Functions

fileDownloader <- function (url, fname, directory = "./data") {}

Create a helper function to download the files. This function achieves the following:

    It ensures that the data directory exists
    If the file already exists it isn't re-downloaded
    It also determines the download mode (based on the file extension)

readInData <- function(fnFileName, ...) {}

There is a lot of boilerplate in the read functions, this helper function takes care of a lot of that.
Variables

These variables appear in the order they appear in the code. As some of them rely on what has come prior, this makes most sense to me.
Variables 	Description
ZipFileURL 	The URL of the zip file to be downloaded
ZipName 	The name of the actual file at the end of the ZipFileURL
dataDir 	The name of the directory that the zip file is extracted to
baseDataDir 	Base Directory of the working data files
testDataDir 	Location of the test data files
trainDataDir 	Location of the train data files
activityLabels 	The list of activities that the subjects were measured against.
featureLabels 	The names and IDs of the measurements that were recorded
featureLabels.meanstd 	Vector of measurements to do with Mean and Std.Dev (TRUE/FALSE)
featureLabels.names 	The actual names of the measurements
RegexSubs 	A vector of regular expressions and substitute text
